A Version Control System (VCR) affords both the individual developer and a 

software team a way to create code or written documentation that tracks and implements changes whilst 

preserving previous versions. This aids collaboration and helps reconcile 

different approaches; and makes it easier to revert to earlier (working) 

versions, which encourages safe experimentation. 

Version control involves taking "snapshots" of a file at different stages of 

its development, so that work progresses on an assured and stepped basis. It 

captures when changes are made; and the nature and extent of the change. The 

changes can be tracked in a way that explains the document's evolution. This 

makes it easier to go back to earlier versions and restore them if 

necessary. 

The benefits are amplified during team-working. Developers can see which 

colleagues made changes and why. They can also follow different approaches. 

The new versions can be merged and if there are any "conflicts" with 

existing code or new alternatives, these are identified and can be resolved. 

A local VCS stores source files within a local system, a centralized VCS 

stores changes in a single server, and a distributed VCS involves cloning a 

Git repository, making all versions easily accessible to all contributors.

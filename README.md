A Version Control System (VCR) allows both the individual developer and a software team to create code or write documentation in a way that tracks and implements changes whilst preserving previous versions. 

This makes it easier to revert to earlier (working) versions, which encourages safe experimentation. It also supports collaboration by making it easier to reconcile different "edits", additions or approaches to a piece of work. 

Version control involves taking "snapshots" of a file at different stages of its development, so that work can progress on an assured and stepped basis. Changes are captured; and the nature and extent of the change is also recorded. The changes can be tracked in a way that explains the document's evolution. In addition, this makes it easier to find an earlier version with particular significant in the project's overall development, and restore it if necessary. 

The benefits are amplified during team-working. Developers can see which colleagues have made changes and why. They can also follow different approaches to developing software (or a document) because their worked (and the team's work) is in effect always anchored through version control. It's rather like having an aerial view of movement through a maze. 

If there are any "conflicts" with existing code or new alternatives, these are identified and can be resolved before the new versions are merged. 

A local VCS stores source files within a local system, a centralised VCS stores changes in a single server, and a distributed VCS involves cloning a Git repository (a central storage location for managing files are directories), making all versions easily accessible to all contributors.
